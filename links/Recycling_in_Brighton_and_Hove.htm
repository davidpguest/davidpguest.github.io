<p><span class="heading">Reporting fly-tipping</span></p>
<p>If you witness flytipping, know who is doing it, or see items left abandoned in public space, reporting options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/recyclingandrefuse">recycling &amp; refuse Facebook page</a></li>
<li>Their Twitter Page <a href="https://twitter.com/RecyclingRefuse">BHCC_Cityclean @RecyclingRefuse</a></li>
<li>The report forms on <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/contact-recycling-rubbish-and-street">their website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting not only deters dumping, but as the report goes to Cityclean it usually ensures that the offending items are fairly quickly collected.</p>
<p>Please use <a href="../links/Recycling_in_Brighton_and_Hove.htm#recycling">social media or recycling outlets</a> to dispose of unwanted items. Have them collected from off-street locations such as your home or deliver them yourself. Small-scale&nbsp;flytipping (pavement donations) &nbsp;establish practices which can encourage larger-scale flytipping:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="bordered" src="../images/pavementrubbish.jpg" alt="trash" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="heading">What is wrong with "Please Take" stacks?</span></p>
<p>On "your own property" nothing at all, but "on public open space" (such as a pavement) Councils are compelled to regard this as fly-tipping, even if the stack is there just for a short time.</p>
<p>The law on flytipping is the same for everyone. It would cost society far too much in legal expenses&nbsp;if, instead of being "a single law for all", there were&nbsp;&nbsp;subtle&nbsp;variations allowing for</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount left on the pavement,</li>
<li>the perceived usefulness or value of what is deposited,</li>
<li>the intentions of owners to remove unclaimed items after a certain time,</li>
<li>the hope that items tidily stacked against a wall won't be scattered by cherry-pickers etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some residents regard "<strong>neighbourhood practice</strong>" as the example to follow. The problem here is that larger-scale flytippers, whose actions can <strong>trash a street scene</strong> and <strong>endanger pedestrians</strong>, may be led by&nbsp;the same example. If neighbours don't do it, it becomes easy to identify and stop&nbsp;the industrial flytippers.</p>
<p>There is a lot on <a href="https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/news/environment/council-blasts-worst-flytipping-crime-in-brighton-as-2-5-tonnes-of-rubbish-dumped-in-road-1-8657824">the news at the moment</a> about illegal tipping on an horrendous scale. The more we can do to discourage it - and to persuade minor players not to take their lead from inconsiderate examples - the more pleasant our streets will look.</p><span class="footnote"> This page was last updated by Ted on 04-Sep-2020</span></div></div><div id="mobilenav"><h3 class="hidden">Site Navigation</h3>
